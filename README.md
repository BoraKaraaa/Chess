# Chess

For my university project, I'm developing a chess game and AI chess bot using the Unity engine. The core of this project revolves around designing a chess bot capable of making smart moves within a given timeframe. By employing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and prioritizing crucial moves like checks and captures, the bot is optimized for efficient and competitive gameplay.
